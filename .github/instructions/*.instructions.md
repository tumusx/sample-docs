## Review Guidelines

### Clean Code
Evaluate and comment on:
- Naming clarity and intention-revealing identifiers
- Function and class responsibilities (single responsibility principle)
- Code readability and maintainability
- Reduction of unnecessary complexity
- Proper use of immutability and explicit types
- Removal of dead, duplicated, or misleading code

You MAY:
- Propose large refactors
- Suggest splitting or merging classes/files
- Suggest rewriting functions or modules for clarity

---

### Clean Architecture
Evaluate and comment on:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Responsibility boundaries across modules and layers
- Direction of dependencies (core/business logic must not depend on platform or UI)
- Proper isolation of platform-specific code
- Testability and independence of business logic

You MAY:
- Propose architectural changes
- Suggest moving code across layers or modules
- Recommend introducing new abstractions or removing incorrect ones
- Suggest restructuring files or packages when beneficial

You SHOULD:
- Clearly explain the motivation and benefits of major changes
- Prefer correctness, clarity, and long-term maintainability over minimal diffs

---

### Review Focus
- Identify blocking issues clearly
- Distinguish between required changes and optional improvements
- Be explicit when a PR requires significant rework before approval
- If the code meets Clean Code and Clean Architecture standards, explicitly approve the PR from a quality perspective
